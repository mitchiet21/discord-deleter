This project contains a Lua script for Logitech G-Series keyboards that will delete messages from a chosen Discord channel.

1. Copy the code from discord_message_remover.lua.
2. Start Logitech Gaming Software.
3. Navigate to the Customize G-keys menu on the bottom tab.
4. Right click the profile of your choosing on the top tab.
5. Click "Scripting".
6. Paste the code into the window and save it.

By default, press G4 to start the process, and hold the middle mouse button to stop it. Open the Discord channel you want to delet all your messages from before you start.
